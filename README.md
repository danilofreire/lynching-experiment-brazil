> **Abstract**: Why do citizens resort to extrajudicial violence? While vigilantism has significantly decreased in advanced democracies, lynchings continue to be common practice in many developing nations. In this pre-analysis plan, we propose three survey experiments to investigate (i) who are the potential lynching victims, (ii) how citizens justify mob violence, and (iii) whether information provision can reduce support for vigilantism. First, we will run a conjoint experiment to assess which victim characteristics are associated with higher likelihood of lynching. Then we will show respondents a short news article about a real lynching episode and ask them whether they perceive the motivations of the lynch mob as legitimate. Lastly, we test whether providing information about legal punishment for lynching perpetrators, human rights guarantees, and the risk of retribution makes respondents less likely to endorse extralegal violence. We will run the experiments in Brazil, a country which has seen a sharp rise in vigilante attacks and currently experiences one lynching attempt per day. Our survey will be conducted online and include 2,000 participants.
