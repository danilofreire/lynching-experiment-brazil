> **Abstract**: Why do people support extrajudicial violence? Past studies find that state absence or excessive protection of offenders' rights lead to more vigilantism. In this paper, we identify an important role for cultural norms in explaining attitudes towards lynching. In a series of survey experiments with respondents in Brazil, we examine how people view different motivations for lynchings, which characteristics of lynching scenarios are associated with greater support for lynching, and whether providing different types of information about lynching reduces support for them. We find  that people do not believe that criminal justice institutions should be relied on to solve serious crimes, and that in such instances, community members are believed to have the right to take vengeance. In particular, our analysis finds strong support for the family of a victim using extrajudicial violence against men who sexually assault and murder women and children.
