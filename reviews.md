Dear Professor Skarbek,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript, "Vigilantism, Institutions, and Honor
Culture: Understanding Attitudes toward Lynching in Brazil" to the American
Political Science Review. We appreciate your interest in the journal.

We have now received sufficient feedback from our reviewers to reach a
decision. While we find your analysis of support for lynching in Brazil
promising, we concur with all three reviewers that the empirical analysis and
its interpretation are problematic for various reasons. Unfortunately, the
required revisions comprise too long an agenda to support an R&R and we are
thus unable to publish your manuscript.   

Reviewers 1 and 2 find the analysis of the first experiment (i.e. your
interpretation of the null result) to be unpersuasive.  They also question your
overarching interpretation of the second experiment in terms of a “culture of
honor.”  Reviewer 2 notes that it is a claim that is not in fact tested, noting
differences with the pre-analysis plan. Reviewer 3 similarly questions the
applicability to Brazil. Reviewer 1 is doubtful that the forced choice aspect
of the experiment is a stronger design than direct questions would have been.
Reviewer 2 questions your interpretation of opinions as indicative of behavior
(via norms) and notes the ambiguity of “justified.”

Reviewer 3 calls for more attention to context, including the complex terrain
of social control in Brazil, the issue of race (which they judge received too
little attention in light of the inding in the second experiment), and the
politics of lynching as potentially part of a political project.

We hope you find the excellent and detailed comments below helpful. The
reviewers differ on what they see as the most promising way forward, but we
judge them as all worth considering as you revise toward publication in another
journal. This ends the review process.

As you know, we receive an exceptionally high volume of submissions and are
only able to publish a small fraction of that work, which forces us to be very
selective and only invite papers for resubmission that have a high chance of
being accepted after revision.

The reviewers' comments appear at the foot of this email and/or in the attached
files. We hope you find them helpful as you continue your work on this project.

We are grateful to you for giving us the opportunity to consider your research
for publication in the APSR, and we hope you will continue to submit your best
work to the journal.

Sincerely,
Elisabeth Jean Wood, for the Editors
American Political Science Review

Reviewers' comments:

Reviewer #1: This paper studies public attitudes towards lynching in Brazil.
The author argue that in this context, cultural norms and ideas are more
important than state absence in explaining the prevalence of extrajudicial
violence. They evaluate this argument in the context of three survey
experiments implemented on an online sample. The first experiment finds that
priming police ineffectiveness, a slow legal system, and relatively mild legal
punishments do not increase support for extrajudicial punishments. In a
hypothetical choice experiments, respondents are more likely to support
lynching when the perpetrator is an adult; male; murderer, rapist or molester
(rather than a thief); when the victim is female or a child; and when the
lynching perpetrators are family members. By far the most important predictor
of support for lynching is the nature of the crime (especially rape) committed
by the crime perpetrator, while race does not have a significant influence. The
final survey experiment suggests that priming the illegality of lynching and
the possibility of violence cycles (rather than human rights) is most effective
at reducing support for lynching.

The paper has several notable strengths. It is concerned with a phenomenon that
is widespread in many geographic contexts (if still quite rare), engages quite
comprehensively with prior work and connects itself to larger questions around
state capacity etc., provides data from a relatively understudied country in
the literature on lynching, presents a clear and transparent analysis using
straightforward estimators and marginal means (along with a pre-analysis plan),
and takes culture seriously in its examination of the causes of violence.
However, in my opinion the paper is insufficiently rigorous and novel in its
theory and results to merit publication in the APSR and is better suited to a
field journal such as CPS.

Drawing on prior literature, the authors make a fairly clear case for why lack
of state capacity/presence and racial prejudice cannot explain all variation in
lynching. However, I am less convinced that their survey experiment actually
demonstrates that a culture of honor (which might itself be caused by a lack of
state presence) is responsible for why extrajudicial violence is common or
tolerated in Brazil. While I applaud the authors for hewing closely to their
pre analysis plan, it is not clear why failing to reject the null hypothesis
(which we are led to believe is that state presence and activity have no major
influence on public support) means that we should accept the null (whatever it
may be). The difference the authors make between "how" the state provides
justice and whether it "can" do so in this context was lost on me. In addition,
the treatments (very short vignette framings) are quite weak, which might be a
sufficient reason for why we don't seem to observe much of a change in
individual attitudes when these weaknesses are highlighted. If people already
have strong priors that police patrols are rare, justice is slow, and
punishment for crimes is too lenient, then it's not clear why a survey
experiment emphasizing these points would shift attitudes to begin with
(relatedly: are people learning anything new or is this a pure priming
intervention?).

A somewhat similar issue bedevils the conjoint experiment. The authors don't
really justify why this is a good tool to measure attitudes and test theories
in this particular domain. Clearly people are not (except in the rarest and
most exceptional circumstances) faced with a choice of which lynching to
participate in, and it seems to me that simply asking people direct questions
(do you agree or disagree that lynching in the case of rape/murder/theft is
justified) would do as good of a job in highlighting the conditions under which
people would support such acts. The results (except perhaps on race if you are
unfamiliar with Brazil's context) seem fairly intuitive. It was simply not
apparent to me how these findings speak to how an honor culture or norms of
legitimacy explain the incidence or tolerance of lynching, especially in
behavior rather than survey responses.

While I understand that this is an anonymous online survey, so concerns about
social desirability bias ought to be fairly muted, it's also not surprising
that reminding people that lynching is illegal or might spark cycles of
violence reduces (stated) support for it. Nevertheless, this is perhaps the
strongest and most novel contribution of the paper, and the authors should do
more to highlight it, while further justifying that these effects translate
into changes in behavior among those most likely to engage in or countenance
lynching.

In a nutshell, I would focus on some of the qualitative and descriptive
findings along with the third experiment. I enjoyed reading the paper and
learned from it and thank the authors for the opportunity to read their
well-crafted manuscript.


Reviewer #2: In this paper, the author(s) use innovative, carefully designed
survey experiments to try to understand Brazilians' views on lynching. There is
a lot to like here. The author(s) persuasively argue that lynching is a major
issue, both in Brazil and beyond, and they display an impressive command of the
literature on vigilantism, the rule of law, and extrajudicial punishment.
Bravo! Furthermore, the paper's writing is clear, crisp, and compelling. The
authors have packed an impressive amount of analysis into this manuscript (and
the lengthy appendix!). I appreciate the author(s)' attention to detail, I
applaud their hard work, and I encourage them to continue developing and
refining this project.

However, I have some concerns about the author(s)' theoretical interpretation
of their experimental results. The beauty of survey experiments is that they're
fairly easy to execute, and the empirical results are quite straightforward.
The challenge of survey experiments is linking the results to the big theories
and ideas we care about in political science.

In the current draft of this manuscript, there are several significant
disconnects between the theory and empirics. Specific issues include:
1. The interpretation of the dependent variables;
2. The interpretation of the null results in the first experiment;
3. Whether or not the experiments actually test and support a "culture of
   honor" explanation for lynchings in Brazil.

1. Interpretation of the Dependent Variables

In experiments 1, 2, and 3, the respondents are asked whether they think
lynching "can be justified" or is "more justified" in a variety of
circumstances and conditions. The author(s) are fundamentally interested in a
behavior, but their dependent variables are opinions. The authors attempt to
justify the leap from opinions to behaviors by stating that existing (uncited?)
work argues that public opinion creates norms, and then norms drive lynchings
(p. 4). If they want to keep this claim in the manuscript, the authors need to
expand and deepen it considerably, by citing the existing research on this
topic and by more offering more discussion of the role of norms throughout the
manuscript. Alternatively, an easier route might be to remove the claim that
public opinion --> norms --> behavior. Instead, the author(s) could simply say
they are measuring attitudes toward lynching and explain why these attitudes
matter in and of themselves.

As a smaller comment, the dependent variables measure the degree to which
respondents think a particular lynching "can be justified" (Experiments 1 and
3) or is "more justified" (Experiment 2). Throughout the manuscript, the
author(s) interpret the dependent variable as "support for lynching" or even
preferences for specific types of individuals to be lynched (see the discussion
of "preferred lynching victims" pp. 17 -18). But that's not really what the
respondents are indicating in the experiments. For example, a respondent may
think lynching is completely abhorrent, but they may be able to see how someone
else could justify a lynching. In future drafts, I encourage the author(s) to
think more carefully about the language they are using to discuss the dependent
variable.

2. Interpretation of the Null Results in Experiment 1

Experiment 1 produced null results. When respondents are told that people
lynched an alleged criminal because police do not patrol the area, the judicial
system is too slow, or the judicial system does not deliver harsh enough
punishments, they do not view the lynching as any more or less justifiable.

Starting on p. 13, the author(s) acknowledge that the null results make it look
like state presence and efficacy do not affect perceptions of lynchings. But
then, in a rather unusual move, they argue that the null results mean that
"respondents simply have little to no faith in the criminal justice system in
general" (p. 13). I struggled to understand how the author(s) are reaching this
conclusion. To support this claim, they refer to the low homicide clearance rate
in Brazil, police violence in Brazil, the lengthy appeals process in the
Brazilian courts, and the rise of Jair Bolsonaro (pp. 14-15). While interesting,
none of this information seems to relate directly to Experiment 1. I recommend
that the author(s) revise their discussion of Experiment 1 to acknowledge the
null results in a more straightforward way.

3. A culture of honor?

This paper's main argument seems to be that a culture of honor is driving
lynching in Brazil. H3 articulates this idea clearly: "Support for vigilantism
will increase if people accept the norms associated with an honor culture." (9)
However, I was surprised not to see H3 tested directly anywhere in the paper.
The author(s) never manipulated acceptance of the norms of an honor culture (for
example, through priming), and they do not appear to have measured beliefs in an
honor culture, so they cannot look for heterogenous effects among Brazilians who
are more (or less) accepting of the norms associated with an honor culture.
These are major holes in the project, given the paper's strong claims about the
role of honor culture in perpetuating lynching.

In experiment 2, the authors find evidence that lynchings are perceived as more
justified when more serious crimes were committed, when the targets of the
lynchings are male, when the victims are children, when the victims are female,
and when the lynching perpetrators are relatives of the victim.  The author(s)
take this as evidence for their "culture of honor" argument. However, it is not
exactly clear how all these findings map onto the culture of honor. For example,
could machismo be explaining the concern for female victims? And given the
extremely gendered nature of cultures of honor, why is the magnitude of the
effect for the crime victims' gender so much smaller than many of the other
results, and why are men and women responding so similarly to the experiment? I
would have expected gender to play a larger role in an honor culture.

Furthermore, some of the results in Experiments 2 and 3 actually seem to
contradict the culture of honor argument. Consider this excerpt from p. 2 of
Nisbett and Cohen (1996):

"To maintain credible power of deterrence, the individual must project a stance
of willingness to commit mayhem and to risk wounds or death for himself. Thus,
he must constantly be on guard against affronts that could be construed by
others as disrespect. When someone allows himself to be insulted, he risks
giving the impression that he lacks the strength to protect what is his. Thus
the individual must respond with violence or the threat of violence to any
affront" (2).

If men are expected to violently avenge even minor insults, then why does the
severity of the crime have such a strong impact in Experiment 2? Wouldn't men
also be expected to avenge the theft of a status symbol like a car?

In Experiment 3, the takeaway seems to be: deterrence works. When respondents
are reminded of potential harms and consequences (retribution, prosecution),
they say lynching is less justifiable. This seems like a pragmatic, rational
response. But it is not particularly consistent with Nisbett and Cohen's vision
of an honor culture in which men pursue vengeance no matter the risks to
themselves.

Finally, the culture of honor is fundamentally a theory about how individual men
uphold their reputations. Yet lynchings are a form of collective violence, and
it is often difficult to attribute responsibility for a lynching to specific
individuals (or even families). If the authors continue with the "culture of
honor" framing for this paper, they will need to reconcile this tension.

Overall, the "culture of honor" argument feels like it may have been overlaid
onto a set of experiments that were designed to test something else. This is
reflected in the pre-analysis plan, which does not make any mention of a culture
of honor and lists different hypotheses than those ultimately included in the
manuscript. I think researchers should have some flexibility in exploring their
data and making new arguments as a project evolves, but the problem here is that
the design of the experiments does not match up very well with the theoretical
arguments in the manuscript.

The author(s)' pre-analysis plan is excellent; it's direct, tractable, and
clearly related to the experiments. I would recommend revising the paper to be
more similar to the pre-analysis plan. If the author(s) are able to narrow their
focus to the results of their experiments (and avoid unsubstantiated claims!), I
think this paper will ultimately succeed in getting published in a good journal.
If it is not possible for the paper to appear in the APSR, I recommend that the
authors consider submitting a revised draft to a journal like Comparative
Political Studies, Comparative Politics, Studies in Comparative International
Development, World Development, or the Latin American Research Review.

MINOR COMMENTS

-I did not find the text analysis very informative. I think it could be removed
from future drafts.

-In the introduction, I'm not sure that it's really accurate to say political
scientists don't write much about vigilantism (and in fact, the authors go on to
cite many political scientists currently working on vigilantism!). Instead, the
author(s) could consider situating this paper as contributing to a vibrant and
growing political science literature on vigilantism.

I would like to thank the author(s) for preparing this comprehensive,
interesting manuscript. I enjoyed reading it, and I wish them the best of luck
as they continue to work on the project.


Reviewer #3: This is an interesting article about an important topic.  The
authors seek to explain through an survey experiment what factors drive
Brazilians to support or not support lynching as responses to crime in their
society.  The methodology is promising and the results potentially interesting.
Still, the paper comes up short in providing meaningful answers to the questions
raised or in dialoguing effectively around key questions in the discipline.

Latin America has experienced significant amounts of social and criminal
violence over the past several decades as the region has experienced escalations
in crime associated with the global drugs trade, rapid urbanization, and the
mass diffusion of firearms. Brazil, the focus of this research, has suffered as
much as any country in the region through waves of crime across primary and
secondary cities.  The country is the global leader in total homicides.  Much of
this has been driven by organized crime groups some of which engage in lynching
and other violent social control efforts.

The complex terrain of social control efforts requires more attention in the
paper.  I understand that the author(s) are cautious in their definition of
lynching to include a variety of possible activities.  Lynching, however, is a
highly charged term in different social contexts and there are multiple
different types of activities that could be included under this framing.  The
authors definition of lynching is highly ambiguous and is subordinated to a very
detailed definition of vigilantism which isn't really the subject of the paper.
Lynching is defined as "a form of vigilantism that is carried out by groups,
with violence, in public, spontaneously, and in response to crime being commited
[sic]."  I am not sure where this particular definition comes from or even
exactly what it means.  As I get into the core of the paper it is left to the
reader's imagination just what a lynching is.  The definition is so broad as to
include someone being slapped once in public but to also include various degrees
of beatings, beltings, whippings, pillories (see Starn's work on Peru) , the
type of torture/murders typically referenced in lynchings in US history or the
"necklacings" identified by Scheper-Hughes in South Africa.  Neither Starn nor
Scheper Hughes work is cited.

Lynching itself is a moving target in the experiments.  In experiment 1 the
definition is operationally a beating, which is, perhaps the most ambiguous act
of violence the authors could choose.  In some people's minds this might be a
pretty mild mode of retribution while for others it could be a fairly extreme
act.  Lynching itself is left undefined in the experiment and, other than it
being a beating, it is hard to tell if the other elements of their definition or
made clear to the reader.  How is a survey participant supposed to know if the
act was spontaneous, for example?  In experiment three the punishments for
lynching are associated with torture and murder.  While this definition does not
foreclose milder abuses it clearly puts the emphasis on more serious crimes
consistent with international perceptions of lynching.

Experiment two is the most interesting in the paper and is consistent with my
knowledge of how Brazilians perceive violence non-state social control.  It is
most legitimate when it is exercised around certain crimes often associated with
sexual violence and violence against minors.  This section provides the reader
with potentially important insights, but the results require further analysis
and discussion in the context of how Brazilians understand honor.  I don't
recall other scholars who have analyzed Brazil as an honor culture like say
Japan.  That doesn't mean that that this isn't an important insight though, it
just requires more attention and framing from the authors to make clear how they
understand this ethical context and its implications for social violence.

On the whole, I am not sure where the paper ultimately takes the reader since
the argument is unfocused.  I would suggest the authors frame the essay around
the second experiment possibly dropping the first.  They could then devote more
time to framing to concept of honor, its political importance, and using that
idea to dialogue with the existing literature on violence in the country.
Experiment three could be used to extend the analysis to policy responses.  The
result in experiment two about police-led lynchings not being justified also
merits some attention given the extensive role of police in extrajudicial
killings.

Another point that this essay makes me consider is the odd way that the essay is
removed from politics.  Brazil has long had an aggressive pro-extrajudicial
killings discourse summarized in the unfortunate slogan "A good bandit is a dead
bandit" thrown around by politicians and others during elections to justify
myriad violence against the largely non-white poor population of the country.
Gema Kloppe Santamaria's 2020 book is not referenced in this essay.  Her
argument is that lynchings are part of broader political projects used by
dominant groups to advance political projects against subordinate groups.  This
essay takes a clinical and apolitical reading of lynching not seeing them or
engaging with them as part of a wider political project or discourse but rather
as a piece of abstract political behavior.  The essay could be strengthened by
engagement with Kloppe Santamaria's book and, more broadly, with the discourse
on extrajudicial violence in Brazil.  What are the political projects operating
here and how are these reflected in public opinion on the country?  The essay
merits more serious engagement on these issues.

Finally, race receives too little attention in the essay.  Its main role in the
essay is the observation in experiment two that Afro-Brazilians are a group who
are seen as a less legitimate target of this type of violence.  This omission is
strange.  The vast majority of victims of extrajudicial violence in Brazil are
almost certainly of mixed race, Afro-Brazilian, or of indigenous descent.  My
guess is that white Brazilians, in that country's complex system of racial
classification, run much less risk of this type of violence despite the finding
the lynching may be more justified against them.  This is an interesting
contradiction that should be further explored.  The authors might want to read
Jamie Alves The Anti-Black City which focuses on racist violence in contemporary
Brazil.

Some more minor points:

The article should reference Gema Kloppe Santamaria's 2020 book on lynching in
Mexico.

Daniel Goldstein's work on lynching in Boliva in The Spectacular City merits
attention.  Kloppe Santamaria's book seeks to critique Goldstein's discussion of
lynching.

Should also reference Teresa Caldeira 1996 piece in Hershberg and Jelin's edited
volume.

P7 But most of the victims are no doubt non-white even if Black Brazilians are
not a particular target

P14 why should they authors simply rule out the results of their study without
providing any evidence.  Strange.  Willis is actually Denyer Willis I think.

P17. It is not clear what "molestation" is and how it is different from "rape."

P21 The definition of lynching clearly slips in experiment three where it
appears more as torture or murder than it does in experiment one.
