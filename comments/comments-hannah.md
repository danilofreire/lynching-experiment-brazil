Dear David,

Thank you for the kind response! Sounds great. Below are some brief comments on your experiments. This is a great study and I'm really excited to hear about what you learn.

On the first experiment, I wonder if it would be worth randomizing another perpetrator characteristic: "outsider" v. resident from the community. In Mexico, "outsiders" are often associated with rumors about morally outrageous crimes like organ-trafficking or child abuse and kidnapping, and there are many prevalent cases of lynching innocent "outsiders" for these offenses. This might not be as relevant in Brazil, but I wonder if there are more or less agreed upon justice codes across neighborhoods for punishing signalled "outsiders" versus known community members. I know you are already randomizing many attributes, but thought I'd mention this since it's come up in MX fieldwork quite a bit.

For the second experiment, I like how you are disaggregating the faces of formal justice: separating the police from the judicial system. I think we have a lot more to do in this vein to understand the causes and consequences of vigilantism vis a vis the state. For T02, I wonder what the range of associations are for individuals when they hear "the justice system is too slow." I'm not sure what the pre-trial detention laws are in Brazil, but when individuals read "the justice system is too slow" will they think that the accused will remain free for a very long time, until the case is heard by a judge? If so, would it be worth stating the association you are aiming for more explicitly? Ie "The justice system is too slow and the perpetrator is on the streets until the case is heard," or something more elegant than that? (It's totally possible there will only be one association with "the justice system is too slow" among respondents, I'm not familiar with the Brazilian case as much.) 

I am really eager to hear about the results you get from the third experiment. If we end up fielding a survey in Mexico, it would be fantastic to field something very similar to this (adjusting for the different national context). I don't know anyone doing an experiment like this at all, and I think it could have broad-reaching implications for future interventions: what kinds of campaigns are effective in reducing lynchings? I think this experiment will help us start to answer this crucial question. 

Thank you for the opportunity to read this. Please do keep me posted!

Best,

Hannah
