# Comments from EGAP Members

* Three professors commented that we could substitute our first experiment for
  qualitative interviews. We could survey the police or members of the criminal
  justice system. Two of them said they thought we wouldn't gain much from
  experiment #1.
  - _Note_: I'm not sure if that is the case. Some of the people who attended
	the meeting had written about violence but using qualitative methods, so I
	had the impression that they were more favourable to structured interviews
	than most people at EGAP. But we can probably include more context using
	existing qualitative work conducted by Brazilian sociologists.

* One professor said that one experiment may contaminate the results we get
  from the other two experiments. 
  - _Note_: we can address this issue by randomising the order of the
	experiments.

<br>

* Two people also mentioned that we should be more precise about what lynching
  is, and make sure that respondents understand the concept. They said we
  should be a clearer about the difference between lynching and lynching
  attempt.
  - _Note_: The term is quite common and unambiguous in Portuguese, but we
	could include some questions in a pilot survey to see what respondents
	associate with lynching. I agree that the distinction between lynching and
	lynching attempt is important.

<br>

* One person agreed that the case we include in our experiment #2 is perhaps
  too strong. Livia also mentioned that.
  - _Note_: I think they have a good point. I'll search for another case.

<br>

* Two people had a theoretical comment about our paper. They said we should
  focus a bit more on social norms. For instance, are citizens indeed sharing
  pro-lynching social norms or do vigilantes only get away with their crimes? 
  - _Note_: This is a fair point, but I thought it falls a bit outside the
	scope of our research. But it's something to keep in mind.

<br>

* Some of the comments suggested that lynching in Brazil might be related to
  criminal gangs asserting power or to toxic masculinity/gendered justice. 
  - _Note_: Although I believe that these factors may provide good explanations
	for lynchings in many places, I'm not convinced that they explain the
	Brazilian case. None of the academics works I've read about lynching in
	Brazil mention any of these factors, and I'm pretty sure that lynching is
	not directly related to gang activity (criminals are the major victims of
	lynchings in the country). So this means that we should emphasise how the
	dynamics of citizen violent in Brazil differs from what we see in India,
	Mexico, or the USA. It seemed to me that most people at the meeting had
	those countries in mind.

I think that covers the main points they raised last week. It was a nice
discussion and people seemed interested in the research questions. We also have
a list of potential reviewers, two of them (Rosario Aguilar and Alexandra
Scacco) even sent me an email after the session to discuss the topic a bit
further and show me other papers they thought would help.

Please let me know what you think about their comments. I'll write a second
version of our pre-analysis plan this week. 

Thanks!
